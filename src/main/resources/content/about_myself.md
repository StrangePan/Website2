# About Myself

My name is Daniel Andrus. I play video games, write code, and start fun side
projects. Sometimes I even finish those side projects. I also work as a
full-time software engineer on the side. My Internet alias is "StrangePan"
(previously "Deaboy"), and "vido gams and code" is my tagline.

I grew up in Southern California and earned my high school degree in 2009. In
2010, I moved from Los Angeles to a little town called Spearfish, South Dakota.
There, I attended college at Black Hills State University for two years while
outside of classes I became interested in programming. In 2012, I transferred to
the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where I graduated with a
bachelor's degree in computer science in May, 2016.

Today, I am living back in California, in the lovely San Francisco Bay area
where I work as a software engineer for YouTube. By day, I work hard to make the
Android YouTube app better for everyone. By night, I play Magic the Gathering
and watch Rick and Morty.

As I continue to develop my career, my passion for programming and video games
has not diminished. I have a number of small PC game projects that I work on
when I want to try new ideas. Some of my side projects can be found on the
[projects](/projects/) page of this site.
