# About This Site

This website is intended to be a place for me to showcase my abilities, share my
personal projects, and express myself. It is a playground for me and my hobbies.
I use this site to post personal and professional information. My long-term
desire for this site is for it to serve as a personal library of references,
links, code samples, and anything else that I find intriguing.

Every line of this website has been hand-coded from scratch, with the exception
of third-party font faces, icons, and libraries. The reason I have chosen to
build a custom website rather than use a content management system such as
WordPress or Joomla is simple; I want first-hand experience working with new web
technologies and building powerful applications. Technology is my passion; I
want to seize every opportunity I can to learn about these wonderful machines
known as "computers."

This site is updated whenever I have time or interest to do so. It is designed
to be simple and minimalistic while presenting information in a clean and
logical manner. The simplicity of this site is an exercise in clear design.
